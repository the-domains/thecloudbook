A Book that talks about Cloud Computing and IT

****

**Cloud Computing is
a "daily spoken" and most commonly used terminology in every forum. Every
conversation with a CIO has a reference to cloud computing. This book is
written with an intention of simplifying cloud computing and explaining what is
cloud computing's impact on Enterprise IT and How business should be prepared
to leverage the benefits of cloud in the right way. Not understanding what's
cloud computing or lagging in the cloud adoption strategy could mean being left
alone amidst the technology leap. **
